# Software updates
{: .no_toc }

As detailed in [Git Workflow](https://github.com/Audiveris/audiveris/wiki/Git-Workflow) article
on Audiveris Wiki:

- Audiveris development is performed on specific GitHub "**development**" branch.   
  It is thus continuously available for anyone that pulls and builds the software from source.

- The default "**master**" branch is updated only for software releases.   
  At this time only, a new release is created and uploaded to the [Releases section](https://github.com/Audiveris/audiveris/releases) on GitHub site.
