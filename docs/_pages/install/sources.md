### Dependencies

* [Java Development Kit (JDK)][1]: version 11 (higher numbers may work, to be confirmed).
  Audiveris 5.2 runs only on 64-bit architectures.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com): version control system.

* [Tesseract OCR][2]: Audiveris engine delegates to Tesseract *libraries* the recognition of any
text item (lyrics, title, directions, part names, etc...).
These libraries are automatically pulled as Gradle dependencies, but you will need Tesseract
*language files* for this OCR to work properly.  
Pick up at least the english (`eng`) language data.
Other languages can be installed too, like `deu`, `ita`, `fra`, etc.
Please check the [Tesseract guide][3] for further details and make sure to grab language data
for Tesseract **3.04** rather than 4.0.  
Note that you can still run Audiveris without any Tesseract language file, you will simply get a
warning at launch time, and of course any text recognition will not be effective.  
Language installation depends on your OS. Here are examples to add Russian language (`rus`):
  - Linux-Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-rus`
  - MacOS: `sudo port install tesseract-rus`
  - Windows:
    1. Download russian language data from
    [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/tree/master/rus](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata/tree/master/rus)
    into `c:\Program Files (x86)\tesseract-ocr\tessdata`
    2. Make sure the environment variable `TESSDATA_PREFIX` contains the full path to the parent of
    `tessdata` folder, that is `c:\Program Files (x86)\tesseract-ocr\`.  

  At runtime, you can specify which languages should be tried by the OCR software.
  By default, these are `deu`, `eng`, `ita`, `fra` as specified by the application constant
  `org.audiveris.omr.text.Language.defaultSpecification`.  
  You can modify this default by changing the constant value either interactively
  (using the menu `Tools|Options`) or in batch
  (using `-option org.audiveris.omr.text.Language.defaultSpecification=ita+fra+eng+deu+rus)`.  
  You can also, using the `Book | Set Book Parameters` menu, change the language(s) default or
  override it at book and even sheet levels.
* [FreeType library][4]: Unix-like platforms (including MacOS) need FreeType in your $PATH to handle
those specific PDFs that contain vector graphics.
Fortunately, every known Unix-like OS distribution already contains a package for FreeType.

### Download, build and run
To download Audiveris project, use the following command in a directory of your choice:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Audiveris/audiveris.git
```

This will create a sub-directory named "audiveris" in your current directory and populate it with
project material (notably source code and build procedure).

Now move to this "audiveris" project directory:

```sh
cd audiveris
```

Once in this `audiveris` project directory, you can select the branch you want.   
By default, you are on `master`branch.  
To use for example the `development`branch with its latest features, use:
```sh
git checkout development

# To make sure you grab even the latest updates:
git pull --all
```
You can build the software via the command:
```sh
# (Linux & Mac, or Cygwin terminal under Windows)
./gradlew build
```
```sh
# (Windows terminal)
gradlew.bat build
```

You can run the software, as GUI tool, via the command:

```sh
# (Linux & Mac, or Cygwin terminal under Windows)
./gradlew run
```
```sh
# (Windows terminal)
gradlew.bat run
```

Please note that all these commands use **gradle wrapper** (`gradlew`) which, behind the scene,
takes care of getting and launching the proper gradle version.

### Alternative run

The gradle-based run, as described above, makes sure that all your potential modifications are
compiled before the application is launched.
This is the preferred approach for a developer.

However, if you don't modify the code and merely want to launch the (un-modified)
application you don't need to go through gradle for each and every run.

Because, once you have built the software with the gradle `build` command as stated above,
you now have a `build/distributions` folder in the repository root with tarred/zipped libraries
(`Audiveris.tar` and `Audiveris.zip`).

Simply extract either one of the archives:

```sh
# Either extract the .tar archive
tar -xf build/distributions/Audiveris.tar
```

```sh
# Or extract the .zip archive
unzip build/distributions/Audiveris.zip
```

Then, you can repeatedly run audiveris from those files:
```sh
# Run audiveris (append arguments if so needed):
java -cp "Audiveris/lib/*" Audiveris
```
