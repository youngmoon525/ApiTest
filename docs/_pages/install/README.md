# Installation

For Windows only, we provide an **installer**, in 64-bit version,
which takes care of installing all Audiveris binaries.  
This makes installation very simple but has the main drawback to be limited to the last release,
which can be several months or years old.

We also provide, for Windows, MacOS and Linux, the ability
to **download and build** from source material.  
The main advantage is to benefit from all the recent bug fixes and improvements that are regularly
published on Audiveris project site.
