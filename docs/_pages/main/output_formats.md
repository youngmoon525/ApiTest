## Output formats

There are 3 possibilities for output of a transcribed score:

* Output as **OMR** file for saving and later reloading of OMR data for additional processing,
manual correction or production of other outputs.
* Output as **PDF** file for direct use by a musician.
It writes the resulting image into a PDF file, which is basically the content of the Picture/Binary
tab in logical mode.
* Output as **MusicXML** file for use in a score notation program.
It writes a MusicXML file with the exported score entities.

In all cases, the output is created either in a subdirectory of the default output path
(with the same name as the input file) or can be saved to a specific directory by using commands
in the `Book` pulldown menu:  `Save Book as...`, `Print Book as...`, `Export Book as...`.

There exist similar commands in the `Sheet` pulldown menu to output just one sheet.
