## Main window

![](../assets/images/chula_transcribed.png)

The Audiveris main window is composed of 3 panels:

### Sheet

This is the large panel in the left side.
The "Binary" tab presents the input image binarized into black and white, while the "Data" tab
presents the objects (sections, glyphs and inters) extracted from the image.
In the Data tab, the staff lines are drawn as thin lines.

### Boards

The right panel is a vertical set of boards.
They provide information and editing functions.

Only basic boards are displayed by default, other ones are hidden.
A right click in this column allows to hide or display any available board.

### Events

The lower left panel is a log of the main events that occurred so far.
More details are available in the Audiveris log file
(the precise path to this log file is displayed at the top of the event panel)
