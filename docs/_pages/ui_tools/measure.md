## Measure merge
{: .no_toc }

A right-click in any measure stack, allows to merge this measure with the following one
on the right, via menu `<popup> | Measure #N | Merge on right`
 (which is disabled for the last measure of a system).

It is a convenient way to remove all the intermediate barlines if any, and merge the two
measure stacks into a single one.

TODO: provide a concrete score example.

You can undo/redo this operation.
